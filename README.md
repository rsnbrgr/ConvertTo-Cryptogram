# ConvertTo-Cryptogram
PowerShell script to create a fun "cryptogram" from any quote, phrase, or text you specify
Converts a phrase to a "cryptogram" for people who like puzzles.  You solve the cryptogram by substituting a letter for each letter presented.  No letter represents more than one corresponding letter, and no letter represents itself.  See Twitter's @QuoteCryptogram account for an example of how you can use this program.
